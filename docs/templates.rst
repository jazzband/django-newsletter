Templates
=========
To get started, we recommend copying the existing 'stub'-templates from
the module directory to your project's `templates` dir::

    cp -rv `python -c 'import newsletter; from os import path; print(path.dirname(newsletter.__file__))'`/templates/newsletter <project_dir>/templates/

Email templates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Email templates can be specified per newsletter in `message/<newsletter_slug>`.
If no newsletter-specific templates are found, the defaults in the `message`
folder are used.

When a newsletter is configured to send HTML-messages, the HTML and txt are
both used to create a multipart message. When the use of HTML is not configured
only the text templates are used.

The following templates can be defined:

`message.(html|txt)`
    Template for rendering a messages with the following context available:
        * `subscription`: Subscription containing name and email of recipient.
        * `site`: Current `site` object.
        * `submission`: Current submission.
        * `message`: Current message.
        * `newsletter`: Current newsletter.
        * `date`: Publication date of submission.
        * `STATIC_URL`: Django's `STATIC_URL` setting.
        * `MEDIA_URL`: Django's `MEDIA_URL` setting.
`message_subject.txt`
    Template for the subject of an email newsletter. Context is the same as
    with messages.
`subscribe.(html|txt)`
    Template with confirmation link for subscription.
`subscribe_subject.txt`
    Subject template with confirmation link for subscription.
`unsubscribe.(html|txt)`
    Template with confirmation link for unsubscription.
`unsubscribe_subject.txt`
    Subject template with confirmation link for unsubscription.
`update.(html|txt)`
    Template with confirmation link for updating subscriptions.unsubscription.
`update_subject.txt`
    Subject template with confirmation link for updating subscriptions.

Using a premailer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A premailer is a program that translates embedded CSS into inline CSS. Inline
CSS is much more widely supported in emails, but can make templates very messy
if you have more than a couple lines of styling.

`django-premailer <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-premailer>`_ is an
open-source package on PyPI that adds a template tag that applies
a premailer. Unfortunately, the package was
`broken for Django 1.6 and upwards <https://github.com/alexhayes/django-premailer/issues/3>`_
at the time of writing.
An example of a working version is available at this
`gist <https://gist.github.com/Sheepzez/2f06f0bf54fc33cdcaab>`_
(requires `premailer <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/premailer>`_ to be
installed).

You can then use the template tag in your templates as follows::

  {% load premailer}{% premailer %}
  <html>
  <style type="text/css">
  h1 { border:1px solid black }
  p { color:red;}
  </style>

  <h1 style="font-weight:bolder">Hey</h1>
  <p>Hej</p>
  </html>
  {% endpremailer %}
