Compatibility
=============
Currently, django-newsletter is being tested to run on Python 2.6, 2.7 and the
latest Django 1.4 and 1.5 releases. Apart from tests it *should* be compatible
with Python 2.5 as well.

Requirements
============
Please refer to `requirements.txt <http://github.com/dokterbob/django-newsletter/blob/master/requirements.txt>`_
for an updated list of required packages.

Tests
==========
Fairly extensive tests are available for internal frameworks, web
(un)subscription and mail sending. Sending a newsletter to large groups of recipients
(+15k) has been confirmed to work in multiple production environments. Tests
for pull req's and the master branch are automatically run through
`Travis CI <http://travis-ci.org/dokterbob/django-newsletter>`_.

Feedback
========
If you find any bugs or have feature request for django-newsletter, don't hesitate to
open up an issue on `GitHub <https://github.com/dokterbob/django-newsletter/issues>`_
(but please make sure your issue hasn't been noticed before, finding duplicates is a
waste of time). When modifying or adding features to django-newsletter in a fork, be
sure to let me know what you're building and how you're building it. That way we can
coordinate whether, when and how it will end up in the main fork and (eventually) an
official release.

In general: thanks for the support, feedback, patches and code that's been flowing in
over the years! Django has a truly great community. <3
