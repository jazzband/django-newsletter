Contribution guidelines
=======================
Thanks for your awesome contrib! If you'd like to have your code included in master, there are a couple of things you have to take care of though:

1. Ensure that the way you implemented the functionality is generic enough for other users to make use of and does not degrade the performance of existing users. If you unsure about this, create an issue with proposed functionality to discuss with the collaborators first.
2. Make sure the tests are passing. In any case, Travis should report passing tests.
3. Extended tests to cover any additional code included in your commit. In any case, the coveralls report should report equal or increased coverage.
4. Make sure that any added or changed functionality is documented in the Sphinx documentation.
